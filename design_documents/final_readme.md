# Welcome to Untitled Scroll

Untitled scroll is a web application that generates Modern art using predefined algorithms with an infinite scroll. The webpage currently generates Rothko and Mondrian like pieces.

![RothkoPiece](...)

## Design
The Untitled Scroll was designed and built from scratch in 6 days. The proposal was prepared to implement MVPs to achieve functionality.

## Technologies
* Frontend:
  * The front end and UI are implemented using React/Redux and JavaScript.
  * The infinite scroll utilizes Waypoint, a Javascript library
  * The webpage designing was done using css and scss and icons were used from coinbase.com
  * Images are Canvas HTML5 objects

* The site is hosted on Github can be viewed [here](https://kyle01.github.io/untitled_scroll/)

## Features

* Artist
  * Rothko piece is generated by randomly choosing from a set of predefined colors and randomly selected a predefined dimension.
  `drawTwo(){
    let colors = this.getTwoColors();
    let dx = this.getDimensionsTwo();
    const ctx = this.refs.canvas.getContext('2d');
    ctx.fillStyle = colors[0];
    ctx.fillRect(0,0,window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
    this.drawCircle(colors[0], colors[1], dx[0][0], dx[0][1], dx[0][2], dx[0][3]);
    this.drawCircle(colors[0], colors[2], dx[1][0], dx[1][1], dx[1][2], dx[1][3]);
  }`
  * Mondrian piece is generated by randomly placed vertical lines, then horizontal lines, then determine the squares. The squares are mapped over and a color is randomly picked, with emephasis on white
  `  updateCanvas(){
      this.drawVerticalLines();
      this.drawHorizontalLines();
      this.determineSquares();
      this.paintSquares()
    }`

## Current challenges and future implementations:
  * Additional artist can be added to dropdown menu
    * Adding a API that write to the SQL will allow for live pricing and will not effect other systems.
  * Your suggestions and feedback are always welcome.
