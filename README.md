# Welcome to Untitled Scroll

Untitled scroll is a web application that generates Modern art using predefined algorithms with an infinite scroll. The webpage currently generates Mondrain, Roth, and Stella inspired pieces.

## Inspiration

I'm a huge art fan of modern and post modern art and I wanted to build something that I would enjoy.

## To develope

- Run `yarn webpack`
- Open `index.html` in the browser

## Technologies

- Frontend:

  - The front end and UI are implemented using React and JavaScript.
  - The infinite scroll utilizes Waypoint, a Javascript library
  - The webpage designing was done using css
  - Images are Canvas HTML5 objects

- The site is hosted on Github can be viewed [here](www.untitledscroll.com)

## Features

- Artist

  - Mondrian piece is generated by randomly placed vertical lines, then horizontal lines, then determine the squares. The squares are mapped over and a color is randomly picked, with emephasis on white

  - Rothko piece is generated by randomly choosing from a set of predefined colors and randomly selected a predefined dimension.

  - Stella piece was generated by starting drawing boxes of increasing smaller sizes using recursion and modifying the current color
